Next steps:

1. Set up Rollbar
1. Write basic NeoScrypt miner with:
  - name changed to Compute for Humanity
  - Start on launch
  - New icon
  - Running donation counter?
  - Autoupdates?
2. Add Donate task.
  - Encrypt Dwolla PIN
3. Add basic web frontend.
4. Add Dwolla message to README:

"this application is not directly supported by Dwolla Corp. Dwolla Corp. makes
no claims about this application. This application is not endorsed or certified
by Dwolla Corp"

5. Open-source!
  - Must use GNU copyleft (I think) because of minerd
  - Add liability release disclaimer

Other ideas:

- Animate logo on website
- Display # active users via Redis/heartbeats from miners
- Put running donated total in miners
- Become Apple Developer
- Add Rails website
- Produce DMG for installation
- Add a few other charities
- Add icons to app
- Use temperature sensor to not run when hot
- Use CPU data to not run when CPU is under load
- Have miner ping server for updates
- Rename app
