      Compute for Humanity's goal is to
      <strong>raise money for charity without
      <span class="underlined">any noticeable impact</span> on your
      computer</strong>. It achieves this by:
      <ol class="pretty-list small">
        <li>Running in the background on your computer,
          "<a><label for="mining-modal">mining</label></a>" (or generating)
          NeoScrypt-based
          cryptocurrencies (which is <span class="underlined">much</span> more
          efficient than Bitcoin mining).</li>
        <li>Mining only for <span class="underlined">a few seconds</span> every few minutes, and telling the
          operating system to prioritize it below everything else.</li>
        <li>Monitoring your computer's temperature to make sure it's
          being a good citizen. (It <span class="underlined">only</span> mines when the computer is cool—so it
          won't run when you're editing videos, for example).</li>
        <li><span class="underlined">Crowdsourcing</span>: lots of computers doing a tiny bit of work to each
          generate a penny is better than one computer working hard to generate
          a dollar. (So if you like this project,
          please spread the word!)</li>
        <li>Getting frequent updates and improvements. Feedback sent to
          <a href="mailto:jacob@computeforhumanity.org">jacob@computeforhumanity.org</a>
          is very much listened and responded to, and if you're a software
          developer you can
          <a href="https://github.com/ComputeForHumanity" target="_blank">help improve it yourself</a>.

    <div class="description">
      The mining uses
      <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/" target="_blank">NiceHash</a>, a
      service that allows computers to mine NeoScrypt-based currencies in
      exchange for bitcoins. NiceHash sends the bitcoins earned to an account
      operated by
      <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, a San
      Francisco-based company that allows users to exchange bitcoins for US
      dollars.
      <p>
        A small program runs each day and
        checks to see if the Coinbase account has accumulated enough bitcoins to
        exchange them for dollars. If so, the transaction is automatically executed
        and the dollars are deposited in a bank account (after taking a few days to
        process). Another small program watches the bank account, and when money is
        deposited it automatically sends that money (with
        <span class="underlined">zero</span> transaction fees, using
        <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/" target="_blank">Dwolla</a>) from
        the bank account to a charity randomly selected from the following list:
        <ul>
          <%- Charity::LIST.each do |charity| %>
            <li><a href="<%= charity.url %>" target="_blank"><%= charity.name %></a></li>
          <%- end %>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="tiny-text">
        Note: If you already mine cryptocurrencies on your own, feel free to direct
        your miners toward 1CkZ4233SfQnMyjwypcN1YZorG15VCAPAH. Anything sent to that
        address will be donated to charity as well. If you have no idea what that
        means, don't worry about it!

        Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies (Bitcoin is one of them) with no
        central government behind them. Because of this, there's no central mint
        either—instead, coins are created by a process called
        <strong>mining</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="top-margin-tiny">
        Computers mine by doing little bits of math that help to process
        transactions. This keeps the currency usable! In exchange for doing this
        work, the computers are rewarded with a small amount of new currency,
        adding new coins to the system. It's one big happy cycle!
