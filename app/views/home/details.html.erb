      Compute for Humanity runs in the background on your computer. From time to
      time, it runs some code to "mine" (or generate) one of several
      NeoScrypt-based cryptocurrencies (information on NeoScrypt can be found
      <a href="http://www.feathercoin.com/neo-scrypt-press-release.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>,
      or you can read the
      <a href="http://phoenixcoin.org/archive/neoscrypt_v1.pdf" target="_blank">original whitepaper</a>).
      It only mines for a few seconds at a time, and it constantly monitors your
      computer's temperature to make sure it's being a good citizen.
      <p>
        The mining uses <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/" target="_blank">NiceHash</a>, a service
        that allows computers to mine NeoScrypt-based currencies but be paid out in
        bitcoins. NiceHash sends the bitcoins earned to an account operated by
        <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, a San
        Francisco-based company that allows users to exchange bitcoins for US
        dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small program runs runs each day and
        checks to see if the Coinbase account has accumulated enough bitcoins to
        exchange them for dollars. If so, the transaction is automatically executed
        and the dollars are deposited in a bank account (after taking a few days to
        process). Another small program watches the bank account, and when money is
        deposited it automatically sends that money (using
        <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/" target="_blank">Dwolla</a>) from the bank
        account to a charity randomly selected from the following list:
        <ul>
          <%- Charity::LIST.each do |charity| %>
            <li><a href="<%= charity.url %>" target="_blank"><%= charity.name %></a></li>
          <%- end %>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="tiny-text">
        Note: If you already mine cryptocurrencies on your own, feel free to direct
        your miners toward 1CkZ4233SfQnMyjwypcN1YZorG15VCAPAH. Anything sent to that
        address will be donated to charity as well. If you have no idea what that
        means, don't worry about it!
