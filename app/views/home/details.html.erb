  Compute for Humanity runs in the background on your computer. From time to
  time, it runs
  <a href="https://github.com/ghostlander/cpuminer-neoscrypt" target="_blank">some code</a>
  to "mine" (or generate) one of several NeoScrypt-based cryptocurrencies
  (information on NeoScrypt can be found
  <a href="http://www.feathercoin.com/neo-scrypt-press-release.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>,
  or you can read the
  <a href="http://phoenixcoin.org/archive/neoscrypt_v1.pdf" target="_blank">original whitepaper</a>).
  It only mines for a few seconds at a time, and it constantly monitors your
  computer's temperature to make sure it's being a good citizen.
  <p>
    The mining uses <a href="https://www.nicehash.com/" target="_blank">NiceHash</a>, a service
    that allows computers to mine NeoScrypt-based currencies but be paid out in
    bitcoins. NiceHash sends the bitcoins earned to an account operated by
    <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, a San
    Francisco-based company that allows users to exchange bitcoins for US
    dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
    A small program runs runs each day and
    checks to see if the Coinbase account has accumulated enough bitcoins to
    exchange them for dollars. If so, the transaction is automatically executed
    and the dollars are deposited in a bank account (after taking a few days to
    process). Another small program watches the bank account, and when money is
    deposited it automatically sends that money (using
    <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/" target="_blank">Dwolla</a>) from the bank
    account to a charity randomly selected from the following list:
    <ul>
      <%- Charity::LIST.each do |charity| %>
        <li><a href="<%= charity.url %>" target="_blank"><%= charity.name %></a></li>
      <%- end %>
    </ul>

    Note: If you already mine cryptocurrencies on your own, feel free to direct
    your miners toward 1CkZ4233SfQnMyjwypcN1YZorG15VCAPAH. Anything sent to that
    address will be donated to charity as well. If you have no idea what that
    means, don't worry about it!

  Together, we can have a
  <span class="highlight highlight-1">positive impact</span> on the world.
