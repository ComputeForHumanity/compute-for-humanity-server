<% case @version %>
<% when "1.4" %>
  This version adds an in-app updater, so updates are much easier for you! No
  more downloading the new version yourself... now you can get updates right
  inside the app like magic!
<% when "1.5" %>
  This version fixes a bug that was causing the app to crash on computers
  running OS X 10.10.0, 10.10.1, and 10.10.2. Huge thanks go to Alex Pritz for
  helping to track down the issue!
<% when "1.6" %>
  This version prevents the app from being run on versions of OS X older than
  10.10.3. Huge thanks to Alex Pritz for helping to track down this very thorny
  issue!
