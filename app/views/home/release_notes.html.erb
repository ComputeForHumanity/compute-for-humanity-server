<% case @version %>
<% when "1.14" %>
  This version fixes an issue that prevented updates from appearing in OS X
  10.11 El Capitan.
<% when "1.13" %>
  This version:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixes several small bugs related to how the menu and icon were displayed
      when the app pauses its work because the computer is warm.</li>
    <li>Updates some internals to the app's naming conventions to make it
      more easily identifiable in Activity Monitor and less likely to be
      mistakenly flagged by anti-malware scanners.</li>
    <li>By request from several users, adds an experimental "Use more CPU" mode,
      which allows users to perform more mining if desired. This mode is
      disabled by default and, when enabled, may be disabled again at any time.
    </li>
  </ul>

  This version fixes a minor issue that prevented updates and donation status
  retrievals from appearing in OS X 10.11 El Capitan. A big hat tip to David
  Lago and Sagar Jauhari for the bug reports!
<% when "1.11" %>
  This version fixes a minor issue in which the icon could be hidden for users
  with inverted menu bar colors. A big thanks to David Lago for the bug report!
<% when "1.10" %>
  This version subtly grays out the icon when the mining is paused. (Thanks to
  David Lago for the suggestion!) It also slightly increases the amount of work
  each computer does, so we can raise money slightly faster!
<% when "1.9" %>
  This version makes the installation process even easier by offering to move
  the application to the Applications folder automatically when the app starts.
  Here's to computers doing the work for us!
<% when "1.8" %>
  This version makes updates automatic, so you can always have the latest and
  greatest version of Compute for Humanity!
<% when "1.7" %>
  This version decreases the amount of mining performed, to further reduce app
  energy impact. Wahoo!
<% when "1.6" %>
  This version prevents the app from being run on versions of OS X older than
  10.10.3. Huge thanks to Alex Pritz for helping to track down this very thorny
  issue!
<% when "1.5" %>
  This version fixes a bug that was causing the app to crash on computers
  running OS X 10.10.0, 10.10.1, and 10.10.2. Huge thanks go to Alex Pritz for
  helping to track down the issue!
<% when "1.4" %>
  This version adds an in-app updater, so updates are much easier for you! No
  more downloading the new version yourself... now you can get updates right
  inside the app like magic!
