  This version fixes a minor issue in which the icon could be hidden for users
  with inverted menu bar colors. A big thanks to David Lago for the bug report!
<% when "1.10" %>
  This version subtly grays out the icon when the mining is paused. (Thanks to
  David Lago for the suggestion!) It also slightly increases the amount of work
  each computer does, so we can raise money slightly faster!
<% when "1.9" %>
  This version makes the installation process even easier by offering to move
  the application to the Applications folder automatically when the app starts.
  Here's to computers doing the work for us!
<% when "1.8" %>
  This version makes updates automatic, so you can always have the latest and
  greatest version of Compute for Humanity!
<% when "1.7" %>
  This version decreases the amount of mining performed, to further reduce app
  energy impact. Wahoo!
<% when "1.6" %>
  This version prevents the app from being run on versions of OS X older than
  10.10.3. Huge thanks to Alex Pritz for helping to track down this very thorny
  issue!
<% when "1.5" %>
  This version fixes a bug that was causing the app to crash on computers
  running OS X 10.10.0, 10.10.1, and 10.10.2. Huge thanks go to Alex Pritz for
  helping to track down the issue!
<% when "1.4" %>
  This version adds an in-app updater, so updates are much easier for you! No
  more downloading the new version yourself... now you can get updates right
  inside the app like magic!
