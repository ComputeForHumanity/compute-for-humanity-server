  This version adds an in-app updater, so updates are much easier for you! No
  more downloading the new version yourself... now you can get updates right
  inside the app like magic!
<% when "1.5" %>
  This version fixes a bug that was causing the app to crash on computers
  running OS X 10.10.0, 10.10.1, and 10.10.2. Huge thanks go to Alex Pritz for
  helping to track down the issue!
