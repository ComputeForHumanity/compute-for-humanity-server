      Compute for Humanity is a small application that uses your computer's
      spare processing power to <span class="highlight">raise money for
      charity</span>. It's designed to be
      <span class="highlight">highly energy-efficient</span> and
      gentle to your computer. You won't even notice it's running!
      <p>
        It works by occasionally doing little bits of math to generate small amounts
        of cryptocurrencies (similar to Bitcoin), which are then exchanged for
        US dollars and donated to good causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just install the program and voil√†!
        <span class="highlight">You're helping the world!</span>
        No registration, no price tag, no hoops to jump through.
