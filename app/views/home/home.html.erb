<div class="description">
  Compute for Humanity is a small application that uses your computer's
  spare processing power to <span class="highlight highlight-3">raise money for
  charity</span>. It's designed to be
  <span class="highlight highlight-1">highly energy-efficient</span> and
  gentle to your computer. You won't even notice it's running!
  <p>
    It works by occasionally doing little bits of math to generate small amounts
    of cryptocurrencies (like
    <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/what-is-bitcoin" target="_blank" class="underlined">Bitcoin</a>),
    which are then exchanged for US dollars and donated to good causes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just install the program and voil√†!
