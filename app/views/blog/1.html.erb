      <h2>Version 2.0 released!</h2>
      <div class="subtitle">Or: “💖 Actually”</div>
      I'm beyond thrilled to say that
      <%= link_to "Compute for Humanity", :root %> <strong>2.0</strong> is
      finally released. This is the <strong>biggest release yet</strong>, a
      complete redesign packed with a whole bunch of fun goodies that make
      Compute for Humanity better than ever.
      <p><i>(If you're new here, Compute for Humanity is a free program that
        uses your computer's spare processing power to donate money to
        charity—all at absolutely no cost to you.)</i></p>
      <p>One of my favorite things about Compute for Humanity from the very
        beginning has been how easy it is to get started. Download, open, and
        you're good to go. No registration, no price tag, no hoops to jump
        through. And all of that is still true about Compute for Humanity: once
        you download it you can forget about it forever and you're still doing
        good for the world. That's a <strong>really powerful thing</strong>.</p>
      <p>But Compute for Humanity is only effective if it has lots of users.
        With 100 or 1,000 or 10,000 users it can make an impact, but with only a
        dozen or so it simply generates money too slowly to really make a
        difference for the charities it supports. <strong>This is a conscious
        choice</strong>: Compute for Humanity works hard to have an
        <%= link_to "extremely low footprint", :details %>—you won't even notice
        it's running—but as a result it generates money very slowly.</p>
      <p>The truth is, right now we don't have enough users. So one of 2.0's
        focuses has been adding that previously-missing element of fun. Compute
        for Humanity 2.0 is (I hope) both <strong>fun to use</strong> and
        <strong>fun to share</strong> with others—the kind of app you tell your
        friend about because it has literally more 💖🤗💃 emoji than you have
        ever 👀 in one place. I hope that together we can spread the word to
        families, coworkers, friends, and friends-of-friends so that this
        project grows and achieves its enormous potential.
        Because
        <span class="highlight">the world deserves more good in it</span>.</p>
