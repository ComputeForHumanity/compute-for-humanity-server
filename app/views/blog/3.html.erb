      <h2>Making a blog without making a blog</h2>
      <div class="subtitle">Or: “A blog post about blog posts” <span class="label warning">TECH</span></div>
      When I first set out to create this blog, my first thought was: “<span class="italic">What tools should I use?</span>”
      <p>
        I'd used <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">WordPress</a>
        before, so that was an obvious choice. But I'm also a Ruby guy, so maybe
        something like
        <a href="http://octopress.org" target="_blank">Octopress</a> or
        <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> would be good
        too. But this site already uses Rails, so should I use
        <a href="https://github.com/publify/publify" target="_blank">Publify</a>
        instead? Or
        <a href="https://github.com/jipiboily/monologue" target="_blank">Monologue</a>?
        <a href="https://github.com/KatanaCode/blogit" target="_blank">blogit</a>?
        <a href="https://buttercms.com" target="_blank">ButterCMS</a>?
        <a href="https://github.com/salkar/inkwell" target="_blank">Inkwell</a>?
        <a href="https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/search?utf8=✓&q=blog" target="_blank">Something else</a>?
        Of course the only logical thing left to do was to spend
        <span class="underlined italic">hours</span>
        testing all of the options, creating mock databases and downloading
        command-line tools and making feature comparison spreadsheets.
      <p>
      <p><strong>Or... <span class="underlined">not</span>.</strong></p>
      <h3>A blog post is just text</h3>
      A blog post is just a bunch of text on a page (and sometimes a 🙃 or
      twelve). I already know how to make
      text appear on a page in Rails, and I haven't needed fancy tools so far.
      Sure, some blogging systems give you calendars and tags and fancy CMS
      admin tools, but that's really just more to manage and doesn't give me
      any benefit until there are enough posts to warrant more organization.
      <h3>My homemade blog setup</h3>
      So I made my own blogging system. I call it
      <span class="highlight">🎀 The Non-Blog Blog™ 🎀</span>. Routes are just
      whatever I want them to be:<br><br>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/JacobEvelyn/8f839f0c33d8b127528b6473695d2b95.js"></script>
      And here's the controller, in all its minimalist glory:<br><br>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/JacobEvelyn/b68c2c7fdac6d8ddcee9e28174629ddc.js"></script>
      And the posts themselves are just—<span class="italic">gasp</span>—normal
      views. When I write new posts, I—<span class="italic">double gasp</span>—copy
      and paste the teaser snippet onto the blog index page, which takes about
      1.3 seconds if I'm really taking my time.
      <p>
        Sure, there are features I don't have. But this system also gives me
        more freedom than some other options. (Just look at all the creative
        formatting on <%= link_to "this page", :blog_2, target: "_blank" %> and
        try doing that in WordPress.)
      </p>
      <h3>I'm not saying not to use tools</h3>
      I haven't sworn off blogging tools. Maybe eventually I'll move to one of the
      many options out there. But that feels like a decision to make when I have
      20+ posts, not when I have three. So for now, I'm quite content with
      <span class="highlight">🎀 The Non-Blog Blog™ 🎀</span>, thank you very
      much.
      <p>
        <span class="italic">If you want to see me use</span>
